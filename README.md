# Malware-detection-using-Deep-Learning-Algorithms



The aim of this project was to build algorithms based on Deep Learning techniques, that detects malware. Malware is an undesired and harmful software that can be present in computers and pretends to be legitimate when in reality it can cause a wide range of cyber security problems. These malwares have to be detected and eliminated as soon as possible from the system and hence Malware detection is crucial for maintaining cyber safety and security. It provides protection from hackers and other forms of cybercrimes. This is extremely needed in todayâ€™s times as the number of cyber security issues have been rapidly increasing by the day. This was done with the help of Google Colab and the Python language. Different tasks like data pre-processing, creation, training and evaluating of models was carried out. Prior to this, a general skill building of image processing and deep learning algorithms was performed. For training and testing of the model, the Malimg dataset was used.
